OpenAI Chat Prompter Script


This script lets you insert predefined prompts into the OpenAI Chat input using a keyboard shortcut. To use it, install Tampermonkey on Chrome (or some other extension that lets you execute javascript on predefined pages) and follow these steps:


Open the OpenAI Chat webpage and select "Create new script" option from the Tampermonkey extension menu.

Paste the script inside the text editor.

Define your prompts in the keyMappings section by specifying the key combination and the prompt.

Press Alt+\<key\> to insert a prompt into the chat input box.


Notes:

Use keycodes instead of special characters(@..).
Save the script after making changes.
